# Generate compile_commands.json for clang-tidy based on a GCC compile database.
#
# ESP-IDF v6.0+ uses picolibc via -specs=picolibc.specs, which Clang does not
# support.  This script queries GCC for the system include paths that the specs
# file would add and injects them as -isystem flags so that clang-tidy sees the
# correct (picolibc) headers instead of the legacy newlib ones.
#
# Usage: generate-clang-compile-db.py [build-dir]
#
# build-dir defaults to "build-carrot" (matching tools/build.sh's default
# platform); pass the actual build directory (e.g. "build-spinach") when
# building a different platform.
