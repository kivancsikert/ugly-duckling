# MAC-Based Device Selection and Build Consolidation

## Goal

Replace per-generation compile-time device selection with runtime MAC-address-based detection,
consolidating the CI build matrix from one binary per hardware generation to one binary per
IDF target (ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C6).

## Background

Currently `UD_GEN` is set at build time (e.g. `MK6`), and `main.cpp` uses `#if defined(MK6)`
to select which `DeviceDefinition` subclass to instantiate. This produces five separate
binaries (MK5, MK6, MK7, MK8, MKX), four of which target the same chip (ESP32-S3).

MK6 already contains a two-level hierarchy: the single `UglyDucklingMk6` class detects its
hardware revision at runtime via `macAddressStartsWith()` and adjusts behavior accordingly
(Rev1/Rev2 use `IOC2` for motor nSleep; Rev3 uses `LOADEN`). The plan extends this pattern
to the top level, eliminating the compile-time generation split for same-target devices.

## Technical Challenge: Pin Lifecycle

Each device definition file currently declares its pins as `static const` globals inside a
shared `namespace cornucopia::ugly_duckling::devices::pins`. Including more than one of these files in the same
compilation unit causes two problems:

1. **Name collisions** — all five files use the same namespace and the same pin names
   (`SDA`, `SCL`, `STATUS`, …) mapped to different GPIOs.
2. **Registry pollution** — `InternalPin::registerPin` writes into global name and GPIO maps,
   so all included devices' pins are registered at startup regardless of which device is
   actually running.

The solution is to make each `DeviceDefinition` subclass **own its pins as instance members**,
constructing them only when the device object is created. Since only one device is ever
instantiated at runtime (the one selected by MAC detection or `UD_GEN`), only that device's
pins are ever registered. The `namespace pins {}` blocks are removed entirely.

### Knock-on: `createBatteryDriver` must become virtual

Currently `createBatteryDriver` is a `static` method called _before_ the device object is
instantiated in `Device.hpp`. Once pins are instance members, the battery pin is only
available on a live object. The cleanest fix is to make `createBatteryDriver` a `virtual`
instance method (with a default implementation returning `nullptr`) and adjust
`startDevice()` to create the device instance first, then call `deviceDefinition->createBatteryDriver(i2c)`.

This also removes the need for the double-template on `startDevice` — the `TDeviceSettings`
template parameter may be enough once battery creation is virtual.

## Plan

### Step 1 — Move Pins to Instance Members and Make `createBatteryDriver` Virtual

For every `DeviceDefinition` subclass:

- Remove the `namespace pins { ... }` block.
- Declare each pin as a `const` member variable of the class, initialized via
  `InternalPin::registerPin(...)` in the member initializer list.
- Change `createBatteryDriver` from `static` to `virtual` in `DeviceDefinition`,
  with a default implementation returning `nullptr`.
- Update `startDevice()` / `initBattery()` in `Device.hpp` to instantiate the device
  object first, then call `deviceDefinition->createBatteryDriver(i2c)` as a virtual call.

The `statusPin` and `bootPin` passed to the `DeviceDefinition` base constructor must come
from the derived class's already-initialized members. In C++, base-class sub-objects are
initialized before member variables, so a helper base struct (initialized before
`DeviceDefinition<TSettings>` in the inheritance list) or constructor-local values are
needed. The simplest approach: call `InternalPin::registerPin` directly in the
`DeviceDefinition` constructor arguments, storing the result in both the base and in a
named member if needed elsewhere.

### Step 2 — Flatten MK6 Revision Hierarchy

Replace the single `UglyDucklingMk6` class (which contains internal revision detection) with
three explicit classes sharing a common base. Pins move from the namespace block to members
of `UglyDucklingMk6Base`:

```text
UglyDucklingMk6Base   (abstract — all MK6 pins as members, battery driver, shared peripheral setup)
├── UglyDucklingMk6Rev1   (overrides motorNSleepPin() → IOC2; MAC prefix 0x34:0x85:0x18)
├── UglyDucklingMk6Rev2   (overrides motorNSleepPin() → IOC2; MAC prefix 0xec:0xda:0x3b:0x5b)
└── UglyDucklingMk6Rev3   (overrides motorNSleepPin() → LOADEN; all other known MK6 MACs)
```

`Mk6Settings::motorNSleepPin` is removed; the correct pin is returned by a pure-virtual
`motorNSleepPin()` method that each subclass overrides.

### Step 3 — Flatten MK8 Revision Hierarchy

Similarly, replace `UglyDucklingMk8` with two classes. Pins move to members of
`UglyDucklingMk8Base`:

```text
UglyDucklingMk8Base   (abstract — all MK8 pins as members, battery driver, shared peripheral setup)
├── UglyDucklingMk8Rev1   (INA219 omitted; MAC prefix 0x98:0xa3:0x16:0x1a)
└── UglyDucklingMk8Rev2   (INA219 included)
```

`Mk8Settings::disableIna219` is removed.

### Step 4 — Replace `macAddressStartsWith` with `macAddressHasPrefix`

Replace the existing `macAddressStartsWith` in `MacAddress.hpp` with a variadic-bytes
`macAddressHasPrefix` that accepts the prefix bytes directly as arguments:

```cpp
template <typename... Bytes>
[[maybe_unused]]
static bool macAddressHasPrefix(Bytes... bytes) {
    const auto mac = getRawMacAddress();
    const std::array<uint8_t, sizeof...(Bytes)> prefix { static_cast<uint8_t>(bytes)... };
    return std::equal(prefix.begin(), prefix.end(), mac.begin());
}
```

Call sites pass raw hex literals with no array construction needed:

```cpp
if (macAddressHasPrefix(0x34, 0x85, 0x18))
```

### Step 5 — Introduce MAC-Based Top-Level Dispatch

Add a per-target `dispatchToDevice()` function in `main/main.cpp` that selects the
appropriate `DeviceDefinition` at runtime. Both targets follow the same structure; the
C6 binary currently has only one variant but is wired up identically for consistency and
to accommodate future additions.

`startDevice` is a template and must be called with concrete type parameters, so the
dispatch is a chain of `if` branches, each calling a different template instantiation.
All variants for that platform are compiled into the binary.

The MAC ranges for MK5, MK6 Rev3, and MK7 are not yet recorded in the codebase.
**Dummy placeholder ranges are used initially and must be replaced with actual ranges
from production records before the consolidated binary ships.**

```cpp
// Pseudocode — dummy ranges marked TODO

#ifdef CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32S3
namespace {
void dispatchToDevice() {
    // MK6 Rev1
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0x34, 0x85, 0x18)) {
        startDevice<Mk6Settings, UglyDucklingMk6Rev1>(); return;
    }
    // MK6 Rev2
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0xEC, 0xDA, 0x3B, 0x5B)) {
        startDevice<Mk6Settings, UglyDucklingMk6Rev2>(); return;
    }
    // MK6 Rev3 — TODO: replace dummy ranges
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0xAA, 0x01)) {
        startDevice<Mk6Settings, UglyDucklingMk6Rev3>(); return;
    }
    // MK5 — TODO: replace dummy range
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0xAA, 0x00)) {
        startDevice<Mk5Settings, UglyDucklingMk5>(); return;
    }
    // MK7 — TODO: replace dummy range
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0xAA, 0x04)) {
        startDevice<Mk7Settings, UglyDucklingMk7>(); return;
    }
    // MK8 Rev1
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0x98, 0xA3, 0x16, 0x1A)) {
        startDevice<Mk8Settings, UglyDucklingMk8Rev1>(); return;
    }
    // MK8 Rev2 — TODO: replace dummy range
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0xAA, 0x05)) {
        startDevice<Mk8Settings, UglyDucklingMk8Rev2>(); return;
    }

    ESP_LOGE("device", "Unrecognized MAC address %s", getMacAddress().c_str());
    abort();
}
}    // namespace
#endif

#ifdef CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32C6
namespace {
void dispatchToDevice() {
    // MKX — TODO: add MAC range when known; currently the only C6 variant
    if (macAddressHasPrefix(0xAA, 0x10)) {
        startDevice<MkXSettings, UglyDucklingMkX>(); return;
    }

    ESP_LOGE("device", "Unrecognized MAC address %s", getMacAddress().c_str());
    abort();
}
}    // namespace
#endif
```

The function is called from `app_main()` when no `UD_GEN` override is defined.

### Step 6 — Preserve UD_GEN Override

Keep `UD_GEN` as a compile-time escape hatch for cases where MAC-based detection is
inappropriate (Wokwi simulation, factory flashing a specific generation):

```cpp
// main.cpp
extern "C" void app_main() {
#if defined(MK5)
    startDevice<Mk5Settings, UglyDucklingMk5>();
#elif defined(MK6)
    // Default to Rev3 (latest) when generation is pinned without revision
    startDevice<Mk6Settings, UglyDucklingMk6Rev3>();
#elif defined(MK6_REV1)
    startDevice<Mk6Settings, UglyDucklingMk6Rev1>();
#elif defined(MK6_REV2)
    startDevice<Mk6Settings, UglyDucklingMk6Rev2>();
#elif defined(MK7)
    startDevice<Mk7Settings, UglyDucklingMk7>();
#elif defined(MK8)
    startDevice<Mk8Settings, UglyDucklingMk8Rev2>();
#elif defined(MK8_REV1)
    startDevice<Mk8Settings, UglyDucklingMk8Rev1>();
#elif defined(MKX)
    startDevice<MkXSettings, UglyDucklingMkX>();
#else
    dispatchToDevice();   // runtime MAC detection
#endif
}
```

The target split (which device headers to include) is handled via
`CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32S3` / `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ESP32C6`, so each binary only pulls in
the headers relevant to its chip.

The CI build does not set `UD_GEN` for either platform — both go through `dispatchToDevice()`.
`UD_GEN` is only set when needed for local development or Wokwi simulation. The Wokwi e2e
test already passes `-DUD_GEN=MK6`; this continues to work unchanged.

### Step 7 — Consolidate CI Build Matrix

Replace the per-generation matrix entries with per-target entries:

**Before (6 entries):**

```text
mk5-release   (esp32s3, UD_GEN=MK5)
mk6-release   (esp32s3, UD_GEN=MK6)
mk7-release   (esp32s3, UD_GEN=MK7)
mk8-release   (esp32s3, UD_GEN=MK8)
mk6-debug     (esp32s3, UD_GEN=MK6, UD_DEBUG=1)
mkX-release   (esp32c6, UD_GEN=MKX)
```

**After (4 entries):**

```text
spinach-release   (esp32s3, no UD_GEN — runtime detection)
spinach-debug     (esp32s3, no UD_GEN, UD_DEBUG=1)
carrot-release    (esp32c6, no UD_GEN — runtime detection)
carrot-debug      (esp32c6, no UD_GEN, UD_DEBUG=1)
```

Platform names (`spinach` for ESP32-S3, `carrot` for ESP32-C6) are symbolic and
decouple artifact naming from chip identifiers, allowing multiple boards on the same
chip family to share a platform name in the future.

Artifact filenames change from e.g. `ugly-duckling-mk6-release.bin` to
`ugly-duckling-spinach-release.bin`.

The `DeviceCommon.cmake` `UD_GEN` validation is relaxed: when `UD_GEN` is unset,
the IDF target is used directly without a fatal error.

#### sdkconfig consolidation

All S3 generations (`sdkconfig.mk5.defaults` through `sdkconfig.mk8.defaults`) are
identical — all set `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_16MB=y`. For C6 generations we use 8MB.
Replace the five per-generation files with two platform files:

- `sdkconfig.spinach.defaults` — `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_16MB=y`
- `sdkconfig.carrot.defaults` — `CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_8MB=y`

`DeviceCommon.cmake` is updated to load `sdkconfig.{platform}.defaults` instead of
`sdkconfig.{ud_gen_lower}.defaults`.

### Step 8 — Report Hardware Revision at Runtime

Each `DeviceDefinition` subclass now carries a hardware revision number. The revision is
surfaced in logs and the MQTT `init` message so operators can identify exactly which PCB
revision is running without inspecting the MAC address manually.

`DeviceDefinition` gains a `const int revision` member (default `1`) set via a constructor
parameter. Each concrete class or abstract base passes its revision integer:

| Class                     | Revision        |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `UglyDucklingMk5`         | `2`             |
| `UglyDucklingMk6Rev1/2/3` | `1` / `2` / `3` |
| `UglyDucklingMk7`         | `1` (default)   |
| `UglyDucklingMk8Rev1/2`   | `1` / `2`       |
| `UglyDucklingMkX`         | `1` (default)   |

`startDevice()` builds a `modelWithRevision` string (e.g. `"mk6 (rev3)"`) used in both
boot log messages. The MQTT `init` message gains a `"revision"` integer field alongside
the existing `"model"` string field.

### Step 9 — Update Tests

- **Embedded tests**: Remove `UD_GEN` from the embedded test build if it was generation-specific.
- **E2e tests**: The Wokwi e2e test already pins `UD_GEN=MK6`; no change needed.
- **Unit tests**: No chip dependency; no change needed.

## Open Questions

The following information is needed before Step 5 can be fully implemented:

1. **MAC address ranges**: What are the full MAC ranges (prefixes or ranges) that identify
   MK5, MK7, and the MK6 Rev3 total pool? The existing code has prefixes for MK6 Rev1/Rev2
   and MK8 Rev1, but the generation-level identifiers are missing (they were never needed
   before because generations were separated at build time).

2. **Unrecognized MAC policy**: Should an unrecognized MAC `abort()` (fail-fast, requiring a
   known device to ever boot), or should it log a warning and fall back to a safe default?
   The plan above assumes fail-fast.

## Execution Order

1. Step 1 (pins to instance members + virtual battery driver) — foundational; the device files
   can still be included one at a time with `UD_GEN` while this is being done
2. Steps 2–3 (flatten hierarchies) — behaviour-preserving; verify each MK revision separately
3. Step 4 (`macAddressHasPrefix`) — small, self-contained addition to `MacAddress.hpp`
4. Step 5 (MAC dispatch) — requires MAC range data from open question #1
5. Step 6 (UD_GEN override + multi-device includes in `main.cpp`) — straightforward once step 5 is done
6. Steps 7–8 (build/CI consolidation) — last, once runtime selection is proven correct
7. Step 9 (revision reporting) — additive; can be done at any point after steps 2–3
